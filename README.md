# Radar-Imaging
Project one: Direction of Arrival estimation:
Simulated a radar system using a Uniform Linear Array (ULA) to estimate the angle of a target. Modeled the transmitted signals and received echoes to analyze phase differences across array elements. Implemented signal processing techniques to precisely triangulate the target's angular position, demonstrating core principles of beamforming and spatial filtering.

Project two: UAV-SAR Imaging with Time Domain Back Projection
